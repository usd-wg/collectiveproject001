# Collective Project 001

## Description

This is a collective project with contribution from any member of the open-source communities, and in particularly a huge contribution from the OD3E community ( https://o3de.org/ ) providing the main character of this project, `Odie`.

## Primary Goal

We aim at creating a short-story with a single character `Odie` in a still-to-be-defined situation, with a collective effort by members of various open-source communities.

And we are going to render the results in a offline mode (via `usdrecord` and a non-yet-specified render-delegate, probably Pixar's `Storm` available with `OpenUSD`).

The resulting OpenUSD files will be avaiable in the OpenUSD Assets sub-workinggroup (wg-usd-assets).

## Secondary Goals

Ideally, we want the final shot to be able to render also in realtime in O3DE and/or any other realtime renderer.

And we want to provide deliverables in other formats like live-skinning-character Odie and all the dcc/app files (working files) utilized to create OpenUSD fragments to contribute to the final shot.

We aim at having the entire set of files of every goal (source/working files, OpenUSD deliverables, etc) in the `DPEL` library ( https://dpel.aswf.io/ ).

## O3DE Community

This project is centered around the asset `Odie`, generiously offered by the O3DE community ( https://o3de.org/ ).

Original file and licenses can be found here: https://github.com/o3de/odie-3d-assets/tree/main

## OpenUSD Community

The main deliverable will be a set of `OpenUSD` files for the assets, cameras, lights, and all the elements of the short, in a renderable-state, to be able to be loaded in `usdview` or `usdrecord` for generating final images.

We want to leverage `OpenUSD`'s composition arcs to enable non-destructive workflows, as it would happen in a proper VFX Pipeline, with well defined tasks and deliverables that compose together in the renderable shot file.

The asset-structure is a variation of the original structure provided by the OpenUSD Assets WorkingGroup (wg-usd-assets), 

## Version tracking

We are going to be using `git` as main "version tracker", assuming with are always on the latest version, and previous versions are just older commits in the main repo.

The various `CHANGELOG` files in each asset/shot folder will function as publishing-version-history.

## Pipeline

The `pipeline` is made of `python` scripts to be able to, for example, validate or render turntables of published assets.

We are hoping to connect with the `wg-ci` Working group on the Academy Software Foundation slack, and connect some scripts more automatically happening when updates are pushed to the repo (TBD).

## Workflow

The general idea is that the pipeline ensures that all the files needed for assets and shots are already in place.

This makes an asset or a shot already "ready to be rendered".

It might be meaningless initially (camera is empty, no animation, etc), but over time, all the initial empty placeholders for the various `fragments` will be populated by the artists.

Artists update the fragments, as needed by their tasks, and then those will be merged in the main branch of the git repo, so that the assets and shots will always point to the latest fragments.
